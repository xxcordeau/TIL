There are two ways you can set up an approval. You can set up approvals through the workflow editor or the approvals view for your business project. Setting up an approval process can help your team standardize and adhere to effective governance to minimize risk when delivering work. 

Your team may need approval for issues as part of your business process before they can move to the next status in their workflow

Before you can set up approvals, you’ll need to have transitions set for each status. Learn more about how to set up transitions

Set up approvals from the approvals view
Here’s one way you can set up approvals for your business project: 

Select Approvals in your project view navigation (horizontal navigation above the project you’re viewing), then select Approvals.

If you haven’t set up an approval for this project before, you can select Set up approvals.

Select which workflow to apply an approval to. Some projects may only have one workflow in which case you’ll set up an approval process for that one workflow. If you have multiple workflows, you’ll need to choose which workflow and associated issue types to apply an approval process to. 

Choose a status from your workflow to trigger an approval from.

Select Continue.

Select who you would like to nominate as preset approvers. Preset approvers will be automatically added when the issue reaches the status you’re triggering an approval from. You can always modify the list of approvers in an issue later. 

Give the approver field a name. This is a custom user picker field that contains the people you want to approve the issue.

Choose a transition for when the issue is approved.

Choose a transition for when the issue is declined.

Select Save.

Select Update workflow at the top-right of the workflow editor to apply your approval and any changes to your workflow.

Set up approvals through your project settings
Another way you can set up approvals for your business project: 

Select Project settings in project view navigation (horizontal navigation above your project’s view). 

Select Issue types from the sidebar navigation on the left. 

Choose which issue type’s workflow you would like to edit, then select Edit workflow of that issue type’s screen.

Select the status you want to add an approval step to.

Select the plus symbol :plus: next to Approvals in the right sidebar to open up the approvals setup screen. 

Select who you would like to nominate as preset approvers. Preset approvers will be automatically added when the issue reaches the status you’re triggering an approval from. You can always go back and modify the list of approvers in an issue later. 

Give the approver field a name. This is a user picker field that contains the people you want to approve the issue.

Choose a transition for when the issue is approved.

Choose a transition for when the issue is declined.
